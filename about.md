# __What is the pursuit of this club?__

### &nbsp; This club is interested in the development of mathematical ideas in the context of culture. We will start with the question whether mathematics is discovered or invented. We will discuss different approaches to this question and try to understand if it is possible to find an exact answer.

### &nbsp; After the discussion, we will try to figure out why the mathematical language we are currently using in the way it exists. In other words, if it is invented, why did people invent the way we use it now? If it is discovered, still, why did people prefer to use the language or generate the ideas we currently use? This leads us to think about and research into understanding mathematical concepts in the context of culture. It will lead us to talk about the history of mathematical concepts and development of mathematical concepts/ideas in different cultures. How did it affect the development? 

### Another focus of the club will be the application/use of mathematics in the field of art and architecture. How did people use mathematics while creating artistic products? Was/Is it a natural source or a tool in the production process?

# __What will the students produce?__

We will ask students to choose the topics they are interested in and prepare a presentation on the concept/topic related to the questions above. They may conduct a project on the topic they choose and present the project at the end of the school year.
